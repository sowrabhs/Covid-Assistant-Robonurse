An Intelligent Robot Assisting Medical  Practitioners To Aid Potential Covid-19 Patients
The purpose of this paper is to develop a robot-nurse capable of assisting human health professionals in a COVID-19 isolation unit such that health care professionals may discontinue wearing the personal protective kit that they previously wore when dealing with patients at isolation units. The robot can perform most of the tasks carried out by human nurses in a hospital. It can take a patient's temperature without touching them, administer medicines at the appropriate time, assist in sanitizing the individual and their hands, and offer a section for sterilizing medical equipment
