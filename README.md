# Covid-Assistant-Robonurse
An Intelligent Robot Assisting Medical  Practitioners To Aid Potential Covid-19 Patients
The purpose of this paper is to develop a robot-nurse capable of assisting human health professionals in a COVID-19 isolation unit such that health care professionals may discontinue wearing the personal protective kit that they previously wore when dealing with patients at isolation units. The robot can perform most of the tasks carried out by human nurses in a hospital. It can take a patient's temperature without touching them, administer medicines at the appropriate time, assist in sanitizing the individual and their hands, and offer a section for sterilizing medical equipment

•	These are Arduino codes which are to be performed only on Arduino UNO board.
•	Different commands are for different sensors.
•	Although the pseudo codes have been merged into a single program, these are ran on different Arduino UNO boards.
•	For better reading and understanding, comments have been provided, which are denoted using double slash (//) symbol.
•	When the sensors sense any personal, the commands stored for it activates them and operates accordingly.
•	Please install Arduio IDE to execute and run these programs.
•	While executing the program, please remember to install the libraries associated with the respective programs and sensors.
•	Those libraries can be installed from Arduino IDE, in which the program is running.
